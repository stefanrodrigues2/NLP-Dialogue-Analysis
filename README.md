As part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence, I undertook a assessment involving the analysis of counseling dialogues using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective was to extract insights from these informal and less-structured conversations, contributing to domains like healthcare and education. Leveraging my knowledge in data mining and deep learning, I effectively executed the following tasks:

Task 1 : Applied essential preprocessing steps, including lemmatization and stopwords removal, and performed feature extraction using techniques like bag of words and TF-IDF vectorization. Explored deep learning approaches such as rule-based methods, machine learning, and deep learning. Evaluated machine learning systems for generating and classifying text data, employing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Task 2 : Completed comprehensive exploratory data analysis, employing visualization techniques such as PyCharts and bar charts to gain valuable insights. Utilized LexRank summarizer for concise representation of key components of the data. Implemented a sophisticated classification approach involving preprocessing steps such as lemmatization, label encoding, and TF-IDF vectorization. Employed SVM with a linear kernel for classification and achieved an impressive accuracy of 79%, validated through metrics like accuracy, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix analysis.
